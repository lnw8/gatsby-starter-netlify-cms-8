title: Why outsource your WordPress development?

heading: Development needn’t be your core competency.
subheading: Digital agencies should know a thing or two about WordPress website
  development, but they don’t need to code all sites themselves to
  thrive.  Focus instead on web design and digital marketing services, while
  outsourcing WordPress development to us.

  title: We make it easy to outsource WordPress development
  description: >-
    WordPress development for agencies is all we do, and the basics of it are
    pretty simple.


    Custom WordPress sites

    Your sites will be custom coded, responsive and easy to use by default. We like to use ACF, CPT and either the Foundation or Bootstrap frameworks, but we are happy to accommodate most preferences.


    Pay-per-project

    If your workload varies a lot, you can outsource projects to us one-by-one. That way you can ensure that each website project you do is profitable, since you get a fixed-price quote on the build before you send the quote to your client.
description: We offer custom WordPress development both as standalone projects
  with no further commitment, and through renting out our skilled developers to
  your agency part-time or full-time.

        We sell green and roasted coffee beans that are sourced directly from

        variety of coffee beans grown with great care for the environment and
        local communities. Check our post or contact us directly for current

        We offer a small, but carefully curated selection of brewing gear and
        tools for every taste and experience level. No matter if you roast your
        own beans or just bought your first french press, you’ll find a gadget
        to fall in love with in our shop.

        Love a great cup of coffee, but never knew how to make one? Bought a
        fancy new Chemex but have no clue how to use it? Don't worry, we’re here
        to help. You can schedule a custom 1-on-1 consultation with our baristas
        to learn anything you want to know about coffee roasting and brewing.

        We believe that good coffee has the power to bring people together.
        That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
        space where you can hang out with fellow coffee lovers and learn about
        coffee making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
        sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.

    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
